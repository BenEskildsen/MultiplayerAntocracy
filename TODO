- - - - - - - 2023 - - - - - - -
  - multiplayer
    - debugging
      - clients get ahead of server and seem to drift over time
      - if attack (like dash) has no target, not id
    - sessions
      - show other players who've joined, allow map selection
      - don't show play button until players are joined
      - do game readiness handshake and automatically start games
      - vs, coop (simply pick which side you're on)
      - game win condition
    - multiplayer maps (1v1, 1v1v1)
    - remove ways to pause (tutorials, upgrade modal, pause)
    - run game on server
      - pheromone worker
        - remove water
      - critter/ant deaths
      - make it deterministic
        - particularly for grapple
    - rollback netcode
      - queue actions that come in on a later tick
      - insta-play actions that took place on an earlier tick
        - how to rollback and redo actions of npcs?
      - pheromone worker
        - need to run pheromone worker on the server?
        - need to make synchronous so it happens on the same tick?



- - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - - -


- - - - - - ELECTRON - - - - - - -
  - on dev branch:
    - change Play button to Free Play
    - add Campaign button that links to app download


- - - - - - TO TEST - - - - - -


- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - additional level/background type
    - sidewalk/driveway
    - carpet/rug
  - food collection traffic jams
    - when food is collected faster than it is fed, it can create bubbles, then not expand
    - perhaps grow radius when your ants are stuck?


- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
  - can I work in ant factoids anywhere?
    - lifecycle like butterflies
    - haplodiploid
    - percent of individuals as reproductives
    - Argentinean super colony
    - percent of ants not doing anything in particular
    - ants deciding which task to do


- - - - - MISC ISSUES - - - - -
  - fighting termites is annoying because food gets everywhere
  - termite queen is rotated weirdly
  - termites should just not pick up food since they never put it down
  - ants easily confused if you bring food opposite to the direct path


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - -
  - buried doodads don't play nicely visually with moving dirt around
    - need to be able to redraw just part of the image when refreshing
      stale areas due to dirt pickup
      (or also refresh all other unanimated entity types in collision with it)
  - laying eggs diagonally looks weird, should only pick closest space


- - - - - - - WON'T FIX - - - - - - -
  - vines near the edge of the world can bug out
  - queen facing diagonally up can fail to pick stuff up if you're holding W and D
    - appears correlated with the D key
  - moving the mouse/re-rendering when zoomed out is terrible
  - big canvas
    - minimap:
      - image saving strategy for minimap
    - smaller canvas over all that is re-computed as you move around
    - aliasing when refreshing stale positions
  - segmented:
    - tail segment ends up at 0,0 when it is first added
    - for interpolated movement, need to detect opposite angles to reverse frames
  - fix NxM entities
    - fix getPositionsInFront for NxM entities (always use height!)
    - fix jerkiness when you turn to face left or right
      - rotating about upper left square is the issue
  - critters frequently stuck on dirt when they're born, then lay egg where they are
    causing stack of stuck critters
  - use local storage to dismiss modals forever


- - - - - - - CASTES - - - - - -
  - majors:
    - media get messed up easily when picking stuff up and trying to return it
    - have trouble putting stuff down diagonally often
    - can get stuck wanting to go through 1-wide areas


- - - - - LIFECYCLES FOR CRITTERS - - - - - -
  - aphid:
    - lays food, not blocked by food


- - - - - - - ART - - - - - - -
  - ants
    - egg laying animation
    - different queen model
  - aphid
