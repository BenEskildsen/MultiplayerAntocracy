- - - - - - REAL MULTIPLAYER - - - - - -
  - lobby
    - can be an express app with a totally different route
    - then give some sort of token in the URI when joining a game
  - server model
    - tickreducer lives on the server
      - audit for Math.random()'s that happen outside of tick reducer code path
      - how to send state update to players then?
    - make game deterministic, server fires TICK action to both players
      - only need to send queen actions back and forth
      - this would be challenging with pheromones emitted by the queen
    - all queen actions would need a round trip, else recomputing state is a huge challenge
      - with the exception of plain moves?
  - heroku vs aws


- - - - - - SPLITSCREEN - - - - - -
  - audit every playerID == game.playerID location
  - queen-based functions need to take in a playerID
  - render function needs to take in a playerID
  - two canvases side by side?
  - can it actually just simulate a server and two clients?
