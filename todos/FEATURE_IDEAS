<------ ../TODO


- - - - - - BIG WORLD - - - - - -
  - opening story that shows you as an egg, then larva, then pupa that
    demonstrates how the ant lifecycle works and your place in ant history
  - "then everything changed when the Fire Ants attacked"
  - enemy attacks that ramp up their numbers over time
  - spiders w/webs, beetles will only fight back, never initiate a fight
  - termite colony that is mostly passive, workers don't fight at all
  - don't need to kill everything
  - humans that generally don't bother, but also can't really be defeated
  - alternatives to num young queens for upgrade currency
    - queens fly away immediately
    - queens fly away after eating or going to a token or something
    - queens have the upgrade as a property on them, you choose which queen to play as next
    - bigger world with young queen being chosen as new queen, old colony becomes
      an ally (argentinean, it would stay as part of your colony)
    - morph into young queen on site


- - - - - MAIN THINGS TO BRAINSTORM - - - - -
  - How to fit io model best?
    - improve main menu
      - Needs:
        - title
        - continue, import, new game
        - steam upsell
        - about this game (gear)
        - links to source, community, change log
        - blurred background of game stuff going on
    - reduce friction when starting game
    - refactor frontend to use routes
      - can each level be its own html file?
  - Name:
    - Mothership: Ant
    - General Smant: Army Ant
    - Queen Smant:
    - Suburban Crawl
    - Pest Control
    - Sisterhood of the Travelling Ants
  - How to do upgrades/young queens?
    - timer where young queens periodically fly away, giving upgrades?


- - - - - - BIG PICTURE MUSING - - - - - -
  - opportunities for procedural generation
    - have fixed environments, but randomize which enemies you encounter there?
    - randomize queen start location?
  - additional enemies
    - critter that lays food continuously?
    - weak critter that moves too fast for queen to catch?
    - worms, centipedes, caterpillars(?)
    - praying mantis
  - ant species to consider and their tech choices
    - leafcutters
      - econ: many small, weak ants
      - fighting: variety of larger castes
    - jumping ants
      - tank: more hp for queen, aggro
      - assassin: more damage, dashing, stealth
    - army ants
      - no tokens, can only pick up and putdown (either on alert, or when thing is ready
        to hatch, perhaps they take larva to food instead of vice versa)
      - always following queen
      - faster vs stronger colony
    - some sort of aphid-farming ant
    - colony/tech based on complex dirt structures/chambers
    - honeypot ants


- - - - - - LATER - - - - - -
  - improve pheromone decision function for entities >1x1
    - average the values of possible new footprints vs avg values of current footprint
    - can bring back 1x2 young queens?
    - can bring back media only jumping ants?
  - humans
    - poison food
      - property of food, like isPoisoned: true
      - symbol on the food (that maybe displays later?)
      - show effect of poison on the fed larva
      - what kind of level would this be on?
    - foot
      - action for ants crawling up
  - pheromone suppression ability
    - should render something to indicate you're using it
  - termites
    - mechanism for feeding queen, then it laying an egg
    - need token that produces food
      - tokens are only differentiated by pheromone type
        Need another way to define custom behavior for them
