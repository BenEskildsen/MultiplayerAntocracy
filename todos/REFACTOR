  - pheromone spread
    - use getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - put pheromone refresh rate on config (e.g. % 32 in tickReducer)
    - animate steadystate pheromones using sinusoid to select sprite?
    - don't store COLONY: 0, etc. on every single grid cell
    - could use this to pre-store pheromone direction
  - stacking an action MUST be paired with critterStartCurrentAction which is
    a big gotcha
  - NxM entities don't render well with how I'm doing rotations, see renderTermite
  - could be nice to encapsulate entities in a single file
  - transitions between tasks is spaghetti
    - could have a conditional tracking done-ness, then transition function
    - antDecideTask and antDecideAction split ant decision-making
    - antDecideTask depends almost entirely on what you're holding, except:
      - putdown dirt switches to return
      - return to colony when holding nothing switches to wander (for putdown dirt to work)
  - way to execute action at the END of the animation instead of the start
    - problem with effect index is stacking e.g. TURN won't check if this is needed until
      the effectIndex

  - critter, ant, termite, should be consolidated into insect- functions
    (that switch off of family, species, caste?)
  - get types file back up to date
  - config
    - add Config type to types.js
    - does canvasWidth/Height need to be on global config?
      - config in mouseSystem
  - multiplayer
    - split game into serverProxy (will stay as game)
    - fix all callsites of game that use client-only state
  - critters having their own pheromone would need to go across playerIDs
  - refactor blocking types to live on the caste like actions do
    - media shouldn't be blocked by minima, cleanly
  - need to refactor s.t. payloads on actions are always objects -- since if payload is
    e.g. the queen, then she has frameOffset and can mess up the rendering
  - ant diagonal movement
    - seems to not matter:
      - pheromone sprites may need to restrict to 90 deg
      - getting entity positions based on dir alignment in gridHelpers
        - either doesn't matter, or only for MxN
      - insert/remove from grid in entityOperations
      - ants can pass through diagonal gaps
