  - 4 strategies for getting more ants:
    - the strats:
      - killing critters
        - do critters need to reproduce?
      - mutualism with critters
      - stealing from humans
      - stealing food/pupa from other ants
        - this is not really possible because your alerted ants will never pick up pupa
          and take it away successfully
          - could just carve out an exception for holding pupa
      - role of digging? potential 5th strat which is just to dig more
    - how to give you tools to do this that can be (re)combined in interesting ways
      rather than just "this ant is good at killing spiders"
    - how to make them mutually exclusive in some sense so that you can't
      just seamlessly switch between those strategies depending on wherever your queen is
    - these don't mesh too well with the current goal of killing the enemy queen
      - killing enemy queen would need to be way more difficult both at the
        level of the queen's stats AND at the level of organization of the enemy colony

  - ant coordination and cooperation
    - make GRAPPLE more complex and applicable to all entities you fight
    - grappling onto legs to prevent movement of enemies ^^
    - working together to carry larger items a la pikmin
    - chains/bridges of ants (or rafts on water?)

  - thriving ecosystem independent of player ants
    - life cycles for other critters
    - day night cycle
      - could add FoW where only queen can see
      - critters need different behavior day vs night
    - rain/weather
    - plants (how?)

  - random feature ideas
    - water
    - more bugs: praying mantis, dung beetle, roly poly, snails, silverfish
    - birds
    - mutualisms like growing plants, aphids w/honeydew


- - - - - - DRIVER OF ENGAGEMENT - - - - - -
  - the goal of the game IS to get a lot of ants
    - getting more ants should be interesting and fun
    - having more ants should make more stuff possible (in a continuous way
    - while you have fewer ants it should be clear that more cool stuff would be
      possible if you had more ants

  - queen could die of old age, so you must reproduce before this
    - 10 minute worker life == 200 ant capacity, then 20 minute queen life is reasonable
    - between generations, pick new young queens with upgrades
    - and pick new general starting location either in a different level or within this level
    - huge world (400x400, 500x500, 1000x1000?) that takes generations to explore
  - what if you have to assemble something using found items? (eg rocket)
    - could be complicated in the huge world AND impossible w/multiple levels

  - ants vs termites (vs bees vs wasps)
    - start you off by letting you select a randomized young queen
      and then picking a general start location from a zoomed out view
    - 1 queen of each type in 400x400 world
    - each with different qualitative attributes for fighting against
      - termites
        - produce their own food
        - soldiers shoot acid in front of them
        - deep underground
      - bees
        - flight
        - sting to insta-kill, but then die
        - go to flowers
        - 2x2 (queen 2x3)
      - wasps
        - flight
        - 2x4 (queen 3x6)
        - sting frequently, but smaller numbers than bees
      - ants
        - mirror abilities available to you somehow?
    - spend generations building up upgrades to be competitive with what they start with
    - other interesting stuff in the ecosystem to interact with


- - - - - - MODEL - - - - - - -
  - Goal:
    - get 250 ants w/6-7 upgrades
      - leaderboard for time taken to get 250 ants per map
    - get as many young queens as you can for 5-10 minutes
      - leaderboard for num alive at the end
    - keep playing, get as many young queens/ants as you can
      - leaderboard for most alive ants, most alive young queens per map
  - Features:
    - cards w/descriptions for upgrades, in a system that prompts them
    - updated ability bar and hotkeys
    - additional upgrades (for ~12 total abilities)
      - dash, alert, super major, warrior queen
      - young queen, follow, rally, mega colony
      - burrow, dig, major, domesticate
    - leaderboards on start menu (personal leaderboards too)
    - leaderboard infra
    - more stuff to do in world
      * aphids, dung beetles, centipedes, caterpillars
      - feet walking, bird
      - water, vines, flower, fungus
    - music, sounds
    * maps
    * (auto?)save the game in localStorage


- - - - - - - - FEATURES - - - - - -
  - critters
    - beetle
      - give it interesting behavior of any kind
      - have it lay eggs
      - separate from dung beetle?
    - spider
      - start spider smaller and have it grow as it eats?
      - to draw:
        - spider
        - move
        - attack
        - being attacked
    - worm
      - have rear (and all, if w/sprites) segments interpolate
    - aphids
      - food producing behavior
      - moves like beetle
      - charges up on vines
      - uses charge to lay food randomly
    - dung beetles
      - dirt producing behavior
    - centipede
      - to draw:
    - butterfly
      - eggs/caterpillars/cocoon/butterfly
      - caterpillars:
        - segmented entities
        - eat vines
        - at maxSegments turn into cocoon
    - bird
    - foot

  - doodads
    - bird skeleton

  - termites
    - should be some reward for fighting them
      - the fungus? have them turn to food? only turn to food after queen is dead?
    - soldier shoots acid
    - fungus production
    - cap termite colony size
  - bees
    - worker, queen
      - flight
      - sting animation
    - honeycomb
      - egg, larva, pupa inside
      - honey?
  - wasps
    - worker, queen
      - sting
      - flight
    - nest
  - ants
    - allow ants to be passive around certain entities, but attack if alerted by queen
      - vines, aphids,
    - media notes
      - media are bad at bringing back food, get stuck on each other and move slow
      - media are difficult to recruit/keep recruited to a fight
      - media can have trouble putting stuff down (blocked diagonally somehow?)
      - media should be more expensive, faster, and better fighters (more hp/damage)
        - shock troops
        - could get an upgrade to allow them to pick up dirt?
    - DASH attack:
      - the micro can seemingly snag on the target when trying to turn away
    - to draw:

  - ant capabilities
    - working together to pick up larger objects
    - piling on top of each other to bridge water or other divides

  - environment
    - water
      - experiment with opacity gradient for background to make it look like a slope
    - plants
      - vines
        - to draw:
        - leaves:
          - leaves need to figure out their neighbor/orientation
          - should not be blocking -- so separate entity type?
      - flowers
        - sprout from vines?
        - non-blocking?
      - fungus
        - similar to vine, sprouts smaller amounts of food more frequently?
        - taking away the food helps it grow more
      - fire
        - started by:
          - matches, lightning, frayed wire doodad
          - spreads on vines
          - chars dirt/stone
        - could be a pheromone
        - if it spreads too fast, it just destroys everything and burns out
        - if it spreads too slow, it might be unrealistc?
        - how could you sculpt the spread to do stuff w/o being OP?


  - behavior/difficulty tuning
    - enemy entities attacking at intervals/when you hit ant milestones

  - juiciness of movement
    - ants' heads should turn as they turn
    - experiment with using examine sprites during MOVE_TURNS and/or during retrieval task
    - ants shouldn't turn around as much, should favor things w/in move_turn theta
    - ants should do the antennae-thing when they meet up face to face

  - performance
    - incremental pheromone spread
    - png-ifying only part of the world at a time
    - slowing down entities that are further away?

  - local storage
    - tutorials/modals
    - saving the game
