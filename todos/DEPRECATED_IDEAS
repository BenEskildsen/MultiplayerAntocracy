- - - - CAMPAIGN-RELATED - - - -
  - defense level is too hard
  - zoom out on winning level is still jarring
  - on upgrade/select level screen show campaign-wide ants created/lost/killed
  - upgrade tree
    - name -> description, name should be more biological-sounding
    - upgrade costs should be settable per species
    - things like bigger queen are a suite of upgrades that should display as only 1
    - upgrades:
      - workers that lay eggs
        - config list of castes allowed to lay eggs
        - put eggLayingCooldown on the caste (update upgrades!)
      - picking up > 1x1
        - option 1: array of holding
        - option 2: make things like food be NxN and have minima subdivide them
        - option 3: merge newly picked up entity with already-held entity
      - pheromone types:
        - disperse ants
        - suppress pheromones
      - multiple queens
      - upgrade to allow your ants to send out alert pheromone when attacked
      - tokens as upgrades?
      - food-producing token
        - different type of food entity that is the output
        - leafcutter minima should be even weaker
      - bomb token
      - mind control token
      - alert only affects media or larger
