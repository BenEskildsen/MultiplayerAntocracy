- - - - - - - - BUGS - - - - -
  - armored queen upgrade breaks reset
  - getting X ants on the same tick doesn't allow for getting the right number of upgrades
  - pheromone visibility doesn't survive reset
  - can place big entities s.t. they collide with other entities
    - need to check every position of the entity
    - some entities you should be able to stack
      - background, spider web, dead_


- - - - - LEVEL EDITOR - - - - - -
  - allow closing of left or right sidebars to increase screen size


- - - - - - FOOT MODE - - - - -
  - re-configure click handlers
  - render feet at full size
  - render small 1x1 foot when not in foot mode
  - palette UI:
    - mode is selectable to swap out entity palette (same for copy paste)
    - click to place foot starting position(s) (last two clicks)
    - marquee to add to area where foot will come down
    - configure timing
      - how often it walks across
      - speed of walking during one step
  - foot stomp area
    - initialize this area to be the footprints themselves
    - render this area when in foot mode
    - ability to add/remove from the foot stomp area
    - I guess define the direction of walking
    - what would it mean to have non-rectangular area?
      - perhaps always rectangular areas/paths with different probabilities
        of taking them, and with direction associated.
      - perhaps a walking path is the unit you work with, and it is two foot entities wide
  - update foot operations so they land within foot zones
    - entire foot stays inside boundaries
    - picking a direction to walk
  - all this stuff lives on the foot
    - how to distinguish/coordinate between the two feet? master-slave?


- - - - - - COPY PASTE - - - - - -
  - undo/redo hides the copy marquee
  - want a way to copy-paste an entire world across tabs
    - export as series of actions
    - import into the clipboard
    - click to rerun those actions but with an offset


- - - - - - RECORDING - - - - - -
  - recording:
    - UI for this
      - start/stop button
      - reset button
      - how to initiate playback? Only at start of game?
      - which actions to record:
        - SET_KEY_PRESS
        - ANT_BITE
        - START_EGG_LAYING
        - SET_PHEROMONE_ACTIVE
        - SET_SELECTED_PHEROMONE
        - SET_LAYING_CASTE
        - ENQUEUE_ENTITY_ACTION
        - MARK_DIRT
      - is it OK for other entities to just do whatever?
  - playback:
    - highlight buttons that were pressed
    - have the joystick move
    - ignore user actions (at the UI/keyboard listener level?)
