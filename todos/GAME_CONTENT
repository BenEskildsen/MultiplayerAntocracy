- - - - - HANDLING - - - - -
  - joystick
  - enemy queen dying off screen feels really bad
    - should zoom out or move camera over it in slow motion


- - - - - AMBIANCE - - - - -
  - tiles/spritesheets
    - merge tilesheets into one
    - load sprites into state on game start, copy to game
  - workers
  - doodads
  - critters
  - backgrounds
    - support backgrounds in non-square worlds
  - sound/music


- - - - - SELF-ORGANIZATION - - - - -
  - tokens
    - have ants stack things around tokens
      - ants can get cut off from putdown locations
      - can't go up to e.g. food token once there's food there
        - could instead use food/dirt in the tokenradius
        - (could also render pheromone if queen is facing marked dirt)
  - tasks
    - can there be an ants-exchanging-info interaction?
  - tuning simulation notes
    - main issues
      - no overall control/balance between tasks -- too reliant on where ants happen to be
      - need to solve 2 problems: how many ants? And where?
    - track task demand
      - add thresholds to config
    - tasks:
      - explore
        - exploring ants can get stuck going down in the colony instead of out
      - retrieve
      - return
        - can end up in a traffic jam with food blocking off where they need to go
      - feed larva
        - what to do with ants doing this task once larva are fed?
          - if food need <= 0, switch task to return?
      - move eggs/larva/pupa
        - ants don't recruit to these tasks readily


- - - - - COMBAT - - - - -
  - queen
    - blinking animation when taking damage
    - queen should emit alert pheromone when attacked (hard to press and bite on phone)
      - as an upgrade?
    - better indication when the queen is hitting target
  - workers
  - spiders
    - spider gets hungry, starts following pheromone, eats ants, goes away
    - spiderweb
  - colony vs colony
    - cpu ants attacking occasionally
      - get them to retreat after a certain time or amount of losses?
      - have percent of ants that attack (that goes up each time?)
    - cpu queen dash attack?


- - - - - STRATEGY - - - - -
  - young queens
    - should they be fighters? Upgrade for this?
    - need animations for bite/pickup/putdown
  - queen attention/direction
    - tune how ants react to queen pheromone
    - pheromone for sending ants out ahead
  - overworld
  - cpu ant colonies
    - also should be able to dig from time to time
      - for regular chambers, mark dirt in level editor that is dug out later
      - for attacks, have a separate pheromone that passes through dirt which they
        can use to decide where to dig
