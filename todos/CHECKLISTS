- - - - - - - - LEVEL DESIGN - - - - - - -
  - 2-4 food readily available
  - 6-8 food available that encourages digging in a fruitful direction and gets first upgrade
  - 1 beetle nearby that is not mandatory to fight before 20 ants
  - 2ish beetles that block shortest path to more fruitful area
  - mostly enclosed, but with wide open area further away where clashes with red ants occur
  - enable fighting, digging, and farming strategies
  - food concentrated where ants will patrol at allows them to collect that food better
  - hose should be able to run off the world
  - macro-scale view of level is some recognizable area (e.g. kitchen, picnic)
  - adding a new level:
    - save export in levels, reference in levels/levels
    - screenshot minimap and add to /img/
    - reference in mapCards in ui/Lobby
