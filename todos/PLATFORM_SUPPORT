- - - - - - - MOBILE/X-BROWSER SUPPORT - - - - - -
  - Native support
    - MVP
      - canvas
      - document
    - Make Main file as small as possible
    - Make Game file as small as possible
    - Text tags everywhere?
    - native button, dropdown, checkbox, etc. components?
    - add isNative prop to Main and/or state
    - automate build pipeline between the two projects (w/o overwriting certain files)
    - issues:
      - Control buttons don't update (e.g. show eggs to lay)
      - work through getting react running on the phone

  - desktop
    - selecting screen by accident on chrome
    - ev.keycode probably doesn't work on mozilla

  - mobile
    - joystick controls
      - better indicator that this is actually a joystick
      - fix pinch zoom issues
      - the stick itself should be bigger
      - joystick needs bigger margin around facing non-diagonally
      - joystick size should scale based on screen size
    - tapping a button while using joystick is a pinch zoom (except on chrome)
    - safari and chrome (and maybe firefox) have issues not letting up after pressing
      e.g. bite or follow
    - probably just need to re-think how to hold bite/follow
    - safari:
      - after phone is turned sideways, dragging joystick makes URL bar
        re-appear and then allows vertical scrolling
        - can try switching from width, height: 100% to 100vh
    - chrome:
      - can sometimes get in situation where you won't stop biting
      - can still occassionally zoom in, particularly when tapping near text, then
        won't zoom out
      - somehow has no pinch zoom problems
    - firefox:
      - double tapping near buttons zooms in
